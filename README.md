# Plaid Credit Attributes Library

Plaid provides a suite of credit products to help lenders gain a holistic view into a user’s finances. Today, these products is used by lenders in all verticals across mortgage, personal, and business among others - see the [Credit Underwriting Whitepaper](https://plaid.com/credit-underwriting-whitepaper/) for more details on our product offerings and how Plaid’s Assets and Income improve automation and lending process for our customers today. 

In order to better aid the underwriting process utilizing alternative bank data, we have compiled these attributes on Github for developers and data scientists. This library details how to calculate key attributes from the products that can be used in your underwriting flows across negative records, debt insights, income and more. Each attribute has a corresponding function that you can use or adapt to further understand your user’s finances.

You can find the attributes and documentation for Assets and Bank Income attributes in their respective directories.
